## siteSET

	siteSET is a batch script that creates a folder and file structure for most basic web projects.

...script asks *simple* [Y]es or [N]o questions
    
 * HTML 
 * PHP 
 * JS
 * CSS 
  * Sass 
  	* (.scss) 
    * (.sass) 
  

Just a small idea I coded to enable my laziness, I suppose. Lol.
